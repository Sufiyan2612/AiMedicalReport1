This clinical chemistry report provides detailed laboratory results focusing on key electrolytes—Sodium, Potassium, and Chloride—along with associated parameters, to assess the patient's electrolyte balance and renal function. The report is structured to compare recent test results with previous values, highlighting significant deviations that may indicate underlying clinical conditions.

**Main Topics and Key Concepts:**

- **Electrolyte Levels and Normal Ranges:**  
  The report emphasizes the importance of maintaining electrolyte homeostasis, with normal reference ranges specified for each parameter: Sodium (139–149 mmol/L), Potassium (3.8–5.2 mmol/L), and Chloride (98–107 mmol/L). These values serve as benchmarks for interpreting the patient's results.

- **Test Results and Deviations:**  
  - **Sodium:** The recent sodium level is 135 mmol/L, slightly below the normal lower limit, indicating mild hyponatremia.  
  - **Potassium:** The potassium level is within the normal range at 3.8 mmol/L, but previous values show a slight increase to 4.7 mmol/L.  
  - **Chloride:** The chloride level is notably low at 95 mmol/L, suggesting hypochloremia.

- **Clinical Significance of Deviations:**  
  The report highlights that deviations from normal ranges can be indicative of various clinical conditions. For example, hyponatremia may be associated with conditions like syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), volume depletion, or certain renal disorders. Hypochloremia can be linked to metabolic alkalosis, prolonged vomiting, or diuretic use.

- **Associated Parameters and Renal Function:**  
  The report includes Bicarbonate, Creatinine, eGFR, Urea, and Uric Acid levels, which are essential for evaluating renal function and acid-base status. The eGFR values suggest normal renal filtration capacity, while elevated Urea levels (73 and 99 mg/dL) may indicate renal impairment or dehydration.

**Disorders and Clinical Implications:**

- **Electrolyte Imbalances:**  
  The identified hyponatremia and hypochloremia require clinical correlation to determine underlying causes, such as fluid imbalance, medication effects, or endocrine disorders. The normal potassium level suggests that potassium-related disturbances are not currently prominent but should be monitored.

- **Potential Treatment Approaches:**  
  Management strategies would depend on the underlying cause of the electrolyte disturbances. For hyponatremia, treatment may involve fluid restriction, sodium supplementation, or addressing underlying conditions like SIADH. Hypochloremia may be corrected with chloride-rich fluids or addressing causes like vomiting or diuretic overuse.

**Summary:**

This report underscores the importance of regular electrolyte monitoring in clinical practice. Deviations from normal ranges, such as mild hyponatremia and hypochloremia observed in this patient, necessitate further clinical assessment to identify and treat underlying causes effectively. The integration of these laboratory findings with clinical evaluation is essential for optimal patient management, especially considering the potential impact on cardiovascular stability, renal function, and overall metabolic balance.
